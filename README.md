# Funko Pop Collection Inventory

This webpage is an online inventory of a Funko Pop collection. It is useful to prevent duplicate purchases when adding to the collection. Additionally, it is a fun way to interact with the collection virtually. 

## The Back Story

In the last year, my husband started a FunkoPop collection. Our children have enjoyed finding various figures to add to his collection. Moving forward, our children plan to purchase at least one FunkoPop for major holidays each year. As time goes on, and our kids eventually move out of the house, keeping track of which FunkoPop figures are already in the collection will get more complicated.
This webpage tracks which FunkoPops are currently in my husbandâ€™s collection. In the future, it could be accessible to our kids so they can easily see what he has and prevent them from buying duplicates.

## Getting Started
The data for the Funko Pop collection is stored in db.json. To access this data, the user will need to use a JSON server. To start the server, run json-server --watch db.json in the terminal. 

The user will see that there are 2 json files in this repository: **db.json** and **db1.json**. db.json is a smaller collection whereas db1.json is a much larger collection. Using the larger collection showcases the sorting functions and makes it look more impressive. I generally run this using db.json and will copy and paste the larger collection when I want to see more of the funtions.

## Features
The user can:

* view who each Funko Pop is from and if it is for a specific occasion

* add to the collection

## Adapting the Code for New Purposes
I wrote this code to be easily adaptable for a new type of collection. In the future, I could see making an online inventory for Lego collections, my personal library, tools, etc. I attempted to use specific names and ids for features in the code so the repository can be easy to follow and reshape. 
The bare bones of this code can be changed to create an online inventory with rendered cards and features for sorting and resetting the collection.
